These are the sources I used to help me write my codes: www.mongodb.com, google, stackoverflow.com and BCS â€” watching our cloud recordings, using instructor activity solutions and the class activities as references.

## Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
For this part of the challenge, I imported the establishments.json file from my terminal, named the database uk_food and the collection establishments. To confirm that the uk_food database was created and the data loaded properly I listed the databases I have in MongoDB and listed the collection in uk_food database to ensure that establishments is there. Then I found and displayed one document in the establishments collection using find_one and pprint before assigning the establishments collection to a variable.

## Part 2: Update the Database

## Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
